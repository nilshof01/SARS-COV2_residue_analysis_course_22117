### Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to mutate and produce new variants, with the Omi-
cron variant being of particular concern due to its high virulence and potential to evade
immune responses. This study, focuses on the analysis of the structural and functional
changes in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of XBB.1.16 compared to the wild-type
and B.1.1.529. Molecular dynamics simulations and docking analysis were performed
to investigate the differences in protein-protein interactions between the wild-type and
B.1.1.529. The results showed that B.1.1.529 has a higher number of interactions and
stronger binding to ACE2, which may contribute to its higher virulence. Furthermore,
the flexibility of certain residues of the RBD was analyzed and found that the wild-type
structure had significantly higher flexibility than the Omicron and XBB.1.16 variants,
especially for residues 445 and 449. Finally, a mutational scan of XBB.1.16 for variants
of concern such as 417, 484 and 501 was conducted. The results indicate that Y501 might
remain in future variants while 417 and 484 could mutate back to the origial wildtypes
variants.The findings highlight the structural differences between the analyzed variants of
SARS-COV2 and their potential impact on the virusâ€™s virulence and infectivity and give
an outlook to potential mutations in the future.
